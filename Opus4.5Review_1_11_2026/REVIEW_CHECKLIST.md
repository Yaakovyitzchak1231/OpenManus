---

## Review Instructions

This checklist provides a systematic framework for reviewing the OpenManus codebase without reading all 78 Python files. Use the accompanying OPUS_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md for detailed context.

**Estimated Review Time**: 20-30 minutes
**Token Efficiency**: ~15K tokens (summary) vs. ~200K+ tokens (full codebase)

## Section 1: Architecture Review ⚙️

### 1.1 Modular Design
- [ ] **Agents, Flows, Tools separation**: Is the separation of concerns clear?
- [ ] **Extensibility**: Can new components be added without modifying existing code?
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Are components loosely coupled?

**Key Files to Reference**:
- `app/flow/planning.py` - Main orchestration (~500 lines)
- `app/flow/review.py` - Doer-Critic pattern (~150 lines)
- `app/agent/reviewer.py` - New critic agent (~150 lines)
- `Rules/architecture_map.md` - **Complete component breakdown** (see Section "Detailed Component Breakdown" for what every component does)

**Questions**:
1. Does the PlanningFlow → Reviewer → TestRunner flow make architectural sense?
2. Are there circular dependencies or tight coupling issues?
3. Is the executor selection logic in PlanningFlow.get_executor() robust?

---

### 1.2 Flow Orchestration
- [ ] **PlanningFlow**: Does the 5-10 step decomposition logic seem sound?
- [ ] **ReviewFlow**: Is the Doer-Critic iteration pattern correctly implemented?
- [ ] **Status Tracking**: Are the 4 step statuses (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED) sufficient?

**Key Concerns**:
- Does reflection every 5 steps make sense, or should it be more/less frequent?
- Is max 3 iterations for ReviewFlow reasonable, or should it be configurable?
- Are there deadlock scenarios in the iteration loop?

---

### 1.3 Agent Design
- [ ] **Reviewer Agent**: Does the 5-step review framework cover essential quality checks?
- [ ] **Tool Integration**: Is TestRunner properly integrated into Reviewer?
- [ ] **Prompt Quality**: Are the CoT prompts comprehensive?

**Specific Review Points**:
1. Reviewer system prompt (REVIEWER_SYSTEM_PROMPT in reviewer.py):
   - Is the logic & correctness section thorough?
   - Are security concerns adequately addressed?
   - Is the grading standard (PASS/FAIL) too binary?

2. Manus agent enhancements:
   - Is the 6-step CoT framework in system_prompt effective?
   - Does next_step_prompt adaptation make sense?

---

## Section 2: Code Quality Review 🔍

### 2.1 Error Handling
- [ ] **TestRunner**: Does it handle subprocess failures gracefully?
- [ ] **ReviewFlow**: What happens if Reviewer crashes mid-iteration?
- [ ] **PlanningFlow**: Are step execution failures properly handled?

**Critical Check**: Review TestRunner.execute() in app/tool/test_runner.py
- Timeout handling: Is 120 seconds reasonable?
- Exit code checking: Is exit code 0 the only success case?
- Error messages: Are they informative enough?

---

### 2.2 Edge Cases
- [ ] **Empty Plans**: What if PlanningFlow generates 0 steps?
- [ ] **All Tests Fail**: What if TestRunner returns all failures?
- [ ] **Infinite Loops**: Can ReviewFlow get stuck in iteration loop?

**Scenarios to Consider**:
1. What if Reviewer always returns FAIL? (max_iterations prevents infinite loop)
2. What if TestRunner subprocess hangs? (timeout prevents deadlock)
3. What if agent exhausts token limit mid-step?

---

### 2.3 Security Concerns
- [ ] **Subprocess Execution**: Is TestRunner vulnerable to command injection?
- [ ] **Path Traversal**: Can test_path parameter be exploited?
- [ ] **API Key Exposure**: Are credentials properly protected in config?

**TestRunner Security Review**:
```python
# Current implementation:
cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "pytest", test_path] + test_args

# Concerns:
# 1. Is test_path validated? (No validation currently)
# 2. Can test_args contain malicious flags? (Passed directly to pytest)
# 3. Is subprocess sandboxed? (No sandbox, runs in same environment)
```

**Recommendation**: Add path validation and whitelist for test_args?

---

## Section 3: Implementation Completeness ✅

### 3.1 Phase 2 Features (Prerequisites)
- [ ] **Verification Loop**: Implemented with 3-retry capability?
- [ ] **Cost Tracking**: Integrated into PlanningFlow?
- [ ] **High-Effort Mode**: 20→50 max_steps increase working?

**Evidence Needed**: Check if these are actually implemented or just marked done in task.md

---

### 3.2 Phase 3 Features (Current)
- [ ] **CoT Framework**: 6-step framework in Manus system prompt?
- [ ] **Reflection Mechanism**: Triggers every 5 steps in high-effort mode?
- [ ] **TestRunner**: Integrated into Reviewer agent?
- [ ] **ReviewFlow**: Registered in FlowFactory?

**Key Validation**:
- PlanningFlow._should_reflect() method exists and works?
- Reviewer has TestRunner in available_tools?
- FlowFactory.create() supports FlowType.REVIEW?

---

### 3.3 Configuration Support
- [ ] **Vision Config**: [llm.vision] section exists in config.example.toml?
- [ ] **MCP Config**: Multiple MCP servers supported?
- [ ] **RunFlow Config**: use_data_analysis_agent toggle present?

**Gap Analysis**: What config is missing for vision tasks?

---

## Section 4: Testing & Validation 🧪

### 4.1 Test Coverage
- [ ] **10 Test Files**: Do they cover key features?
- [ ] **Priority Tests**: Are review_flow, prompt_enhancements, binary_search tests present?
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Do they actually call LLM or mock responses?

**Test File Review** (from TESTING_PLAN.md):
1. test_review_flow.py - Does it test iteration and feedback passing?
2. test_prompt_enhancements.py - Does it validate CoT framework?
3. test_binary_search_manual.py - Does it verify reflection at step 5?

---

### 4.2 Test Execution Status
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Can tests run or are dependencies missing?
- [ ] **Environment**: Is config.toml required for tests?
- [ ] **Mocking**: Are LLM calls mocked to avoid costs?

**Current Status**: Dependencies not installed (disk space issue)

**Decision Required**:
- Proceed without test validation? (Risky)
- Require test execution first? (Safer)
- Accept static code review only? (Compromise)

---

## Section 5: Readiness Assessment 🎯

### 5.1 Vision Tasks Readiness (Final 2 in Phase 3)
**Task 1**: Add vision capabilities via [llm.vision] config
- [ ] Config structure already exists?
- [ ] LLM class supports vision (ask_with_images method)?
- [ ] Documentation clear on how to use?

**Task 2**: Test vision with image-based tasks
- [ ] Test framework ready?
- [ ] Example image tasks identified?
- [ ] Expected outputs defined?

**Blockers Identified**: [None | List specific issues]

**Risk Level**: [LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH]

---

### 5.2 Remaining Large Sections
**Section 3**: Hierarchical Orchestrator (Complex - High Value)
- Requires: Task graph, sub-agent types, synthesizer agent
- Estimated: 8-16 hours
- Risk: MEDIUM (architectural decisions needed)

**Section 4**: HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)
- Requires: Pause mechanism, feedback storage
- Estimated: 4-8 hours
- Risk: LOW (mostly additive)

**Section 5**: Performance Optimizations
- Requires: Caching, metrics, async improvements
- Estimated: 6-10 hours
- Risk: LOW-MEDIUM (needs profiling)

**Decision**: Should these be tackled before or after vision tasks?

## Section 7: Final Recommendation 📋

### Option A: PROCEED to Vision Tasks ✅
**Choose if**:
- No critical architectural flaws found
- Code quality is production-ready or close
- Vision tasks are independent of any issues found

**Action Plan**:
1. Implement vision capabilities in config
2. Test with image-based tasks
3. Address any issues found in parallel

---

### Option B: FIX ISSUES FIRST 🔧
**Choose if**:
- Critical bugs or security vulnerabilities found
- Architecture needs refactoring
- Test failures would block vision work

**Action Plan**:
1. Prioritize and fix critical issues
2. Run tests to validate fixes
3. Re-review before proceeding to vision tasks

---

### Option C: RUN TESTS FIRST 🧪
**Choose if**:
- Static review insufficient for decision
- Need empirical evidence of functionality
- Test results would inform vision implementation

**Action Plan**:
1. Set up clean environment with dependencies
2. Execute test suite (see TESTING_PLAN.md)
3. Analyze results and make informed decision

---

### Option D: PARALLEL APPROACH ⚡
**Choose if**:
- Minor issues exist but don't block vision work
- Can fix issues while implementing vision
- Vision tasks are high priority

**Action Plan**:
1. Document issues for fixing in parallel
2. Start vision implementation
3. Address issues as they're discovered
